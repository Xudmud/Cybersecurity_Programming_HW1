Homework 1 for CSCI 4742 Cybersecurity Programming and Analysis  

**Assignment Description**
1- Learn about the Caesar Cipher.  
2- Learn about strategies to brute-force a Caesar ciphertext without having the key.  
3- Write a program in Python that receives an input ciphertext and produces its plaintext.   
The program must output every guess in a separate line, and ask if it looks like the correct output.
-----
Example input/output:  
Input  
```
Enter ciphertext: 
>> haahjr
```
Output (y for yes, n for no)
```
Is it "gzzgiq"?
>> n
Is it "fyyfhp"?
>> n
....
Is it "attack"?
>> y
```
------
4- Submit your code. Only the .py file is needed.  
5- Use your program with the following input and respond to the following questions in the textbox.  
Input = "Zdrxzerkzfe zj dfiv zdgfikrek kyre Befncvuxv"  
What is the correct plaintext? Just put it in a separate line in the textbox.  
How many guesses were made before reaching the right output? Just write the number as the second line.  
Example output
```
Life is beautiful
20
```
